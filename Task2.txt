Prioritising simply allows us to ensure our time and effort is placed correctly. For example if you set out to make a cup of tea and prioritise getting the cup and the sugar and everything ready but you forget to boil the water you would have wasted time in the whole process. So knowing what is important and what you should focus on is a key factor when performing any significant task. It is also crucial to reprioritise during the any big project as the priorities will almost always change because you cannot accurately estimate the time and effort required for every individual task in a project. So for big projects its always a good idea to step back and take a look at everything as a whole every now and then.
