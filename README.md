# Gendac Student proficiency assessment

## Task 1
### Develop a production ready Application using the Web API exposed on this site.

#### The Web API hosted on this site exposes an interface for managing a simple list of products. The Web API is available here. The following functionality needs to be available in your application:
- Display a list of all the existing Products with their attributes
- Create a new Product
- Read and display any specific Product's details
- Update and save the details of any Product
- Delete any existing Product
- A readme.txt file to aid the evaluator to set up and install all dependencies for your project.

## Task 2
### Write a short piece on the following topic: Why is it important to prioritise, and how often to reprioritise?

Prioritising simply allows us to ensure our time and effort is placed correctly. For example if you set out to make a cup of tea and prioritise getting the cup and the sugar and everything ready but you forget to boil the water you would have wasted time in the whole process. So knowing what is important and what you should focus on is a key factor when performing any significant task. It is also crucial to reprioritise during the any big project as the priorities will almost always change because you cannot accurately estimate the time and effort required for every individual task in a project. So for big projects its always a good idea to step back and take a look at everything as a whole every now and then.
